How-to Guides Guidelines
########################

1. Start explaining in one line what the user is going to learn
===============================================================

    "This guide shows how to ....""

2. Focus on the actions
=======================

2.1 Don't explain the concepts, only what actions have to be made and how they are made.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    "If you want x, you have to do y."

3. Provide options
==================

3.1 Show the different ways in which you can perform the desired task.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Methods, functions, etc.

3.2 Write a list of the different options before showing each one of them
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Avoid explaining all the arguments/details from each option
==============================================================

4.1 Only mention the arguments that are needed to set the options apart.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.2 Link to the corresponding API reference page(s) for any further details.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Remember that how-to guides are task oriented, not Qiskit-oriented
=====================================================================

5.1 If you are thinking about writing, for example, a "how to use (insert function)", the place to
do it is in that function's API reference page
----------------------------------------------

5.2 If there is only one function/method that enables the user to perform the task, give a very
basic example and link to the corresponding API reference.
-------------------------------

6. Use "you" instead of "we".
=============================

    "If you want x do y."

    "you can do z with a, b or c.""
