How-to Guides Guidelines
########################

1. Start explaining in one line what the user is going to learn
===============================================================

    "This guide shows how to ....""

2. Focus on the actions
=======================

Don't explain the concepts, only what actions have to be made and how they are made.

    "If you want x, you have to do y."

3. Provide options
==================

Write a list of the different options before showing each one of them.
Show the different ways in which you can perform the desired task.

4. Avoid explaining all the arguments/details from each option
==============================================================

Only mention the arguments that are needed to set the options apart. Link to the corresponding API reference page(s) for any further details.

5. Remember that how-to guides are task oriented, not Qiskit-oriented
=====================================================================

If you are thinking about writing, for example, a "how to use (insert function)", the place to
do it is in that function's API reference page

If there is only one function/method that enables the user to perform the task, give a very
basic example and link to the corresponding API reference.

6. Use "you" instead of "we".
=============================

    "If you want x do y."

    "you can do z with a, b or c.""
