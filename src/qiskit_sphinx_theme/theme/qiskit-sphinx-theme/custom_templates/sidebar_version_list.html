{#- The HTML and CSS structure is inspired by Furo's left sidebar's table of contents for a
 top-level page with subpages, but with the text looking like a sidebar caption. It has a
 similar setup to us: a text label and chevron icon to indicate the section is expandable.

 We use custom class names for clarity and because this isn't an identical replica. The CSS rules
 explain in comments how the Furo classes map to our classes.
