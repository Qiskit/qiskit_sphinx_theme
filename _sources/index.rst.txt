Welcome to Qiskit Docs Guide v1.0
#################################

Overview
========

The intent of the Qiskit docs guide is to help Qiskit maintainers improve their documentation and to provide recommendations for good practices for all Qiskit projects.

In this guide, you can find an introduction to creating a Qiskit documentation project with :doc:`Sphinx <sphinx:index>` and `Di√°taxis <https://diataxis.fr>`_, the documentation framework we are using in Qiskit,
as well as some practical guides for Sphinx-related tasks and, finally, guidelines and examples for the pages that make up Qiskit's standard sidebar.
