Pre-requisites
==============

This guide assumes your project already has a working Sphinx documentation project in a
folder called ``docs`` and :ref:`the recommended folder structure <doc-structure>`. If you don't
have it, you can set it up with :doc:`sphinx:man/sphinx-quickstart` following the tutorial :ref:`create-new-doc-project`.
