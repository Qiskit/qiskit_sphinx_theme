Create a New Documentation Project
##################################

.. include:: ../others/tutorial_type.rst

In this tutorial you will use the :doc:`sphinx:man/sphinx-quickstart` command to create a new
documentation project for a repository in the Qiskit Ecosystem with :doc:`Sphinx <sphinx:index>`.
Then, you will structure the resulting documentation according to the Qiskit standard and make sure
Qiskit's Sphinx HTML theme, the ``qiskit_sphinx_theme``, is used. After that, you will create a
GitHub workflow to deploy your documentation to `qiskit.org/ecosystem <https://qiskit.org/ecosystem>`_ (only applicable
for selected projects) with `Rclone <https://rclone.org>`_. 

Background information
=======================

Before you dive into the creation of the documentation project, it's important to know what reStructuredText and Sphinx are.

`reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`_ (RST) is a lightweight markup language, that is, an easy to read language that formats plaintext documents according to a set of tags. It enables the creation of web pages and documentation from, for example, Python docstrings.

:doc:`Sphinx <sphinx:index>` is a documentation generator that converts RST files to formats like `HTML <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/>`_, `LaTeX <https://www.latex-project.org/>`_, `ePub <https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub32/>`_, `Texinfo <https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/>`_, manual pages or plain text. It is written in Python. The ``qiskit_sphinx_theme`` will focus on converting RST to HTML pages.

Install the ``qiskit_sphinx_theme``
===================================

In order to use use the ``qiskit_sphinx_theme`` you need to first install it. You can do that with ``pip`` by running this:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install qiskit-sphinx-theme

.. note::

    ``sphinx`` is installed as an dependency with ``qiskit-sphinx-theme``, so it's not necessary to install it with ``pip install sphinx`` for this tutorial.



Create the documentation in your repository
===========================================

In order to create a documentation folder you can use :doc:`sphinx:man/sphinx-quickstart`. It asks some questions and creates a functional documentation folder according to your answers.
You can use ``sphinx-quickstart`` by going to the root directory of your repository and running this command.

.. code-block:: bash

    sphinx-quickstart docs

So the new folder will be called ``docs``. Then you will get this output:

.. code-block:: text
  
    Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
    accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

    Selected root path: docs

    You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
    Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
    "source" and "build" directories within the root path.
    > Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]:

In this case, you will give the default answer, that is, the one between brackets (``n``), so you will not separate the ``source`` and ``build`` directories. To do this you only need to press ENTER.


.. code-block:: text

    The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
    > Project name: <Enter Your Project Name, e.g. qiskit-hal-provider>
    > Author name(s): <Enter Author Names or a Team, e.g. Qiskit HAL Provider Development Team>
    > Project release []: <Enter Project Release Corresponding to the Documentation, e.g. 0.1.0>

This time you need to give non-default answers. Set your project name and put your development team
name as the author name. If you have a release cycle you can put your current version in the project
release field. Throughout this tutorial, we will use ``Qiskit HAL Provider`` as an example.

.. code-block:: text

    If the documents are to be written in a language other than English,
    you can select a language here by its language code. Sphinx will then
    translate text that it generates into that language.

    For a list of supported codes, see
    http://sphinx-doc.org/config.html#confval-language.
    > Project language [en]:

Here the language will be English, that is, the default.

.. code-block:: text

    Creating file ./docs/conf.py.
    Creating file ./docs/index.rst.
    Creating file ./docs/Makefile.
    Creating file ./docs/make.bat.

    Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

The new folder will consist of:

* ``index.rst``: the RST file that will make up the home page when built as HTML.
* ``conf.py``: a file that includes all the Sphinx configuration settings.
* ``Makefile`` (or ``make.bat`` for Windows): files that enable you to build documentation using ``make``.
* ``_templates``: a folder for your own HTML templates (now empty).
* ``_static``: a folder for static files like images (now empty).
* ``_build``: a folder for built documentation (now empty).

Even though you have created a working Sphinx documentation folder, you are not using the ``qiskit_sphinx_theme`` yet. In order to do that, you need to open ``conf.py``
and change the value of the variable ``html_theme`` from ``'alabaster'`` to ``'qiskit_sphinx_theme'``.

.. _doc-structure:

Structure your documentation
============================

In Qiskit and its Ecosystem, we are following :ref:`diataxis`, that means that our documentation is divided into four categories:

* `Tutorials <https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/>`_
* `How-to guides <https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/>`_
* `API reference <https://diataxis.fr/reference/>`_
* `Explanations <https://diataxis.fr/explanation/>`_

In order to do that, you need to create 4 new folders inside the ``docs`` folder, that you will call ``tutorials``, ``how_to``, ``apidocs`` and ``explanations``. Inside each one of them, add an empty (to start with) ``index.rst``.

Apart from that, you should add a ``release_notes.rst`` for putting release notes and a ``getting_started.rst`` containing installation instructions and a "hello world" example to the ``docs`` folder. 

In short, the recommended structure of your documentation is:

.. code-block:: text

   docs/
   |--conf.py
   |--index.rst
   |--getting_started.rst
   |--release_notes.rst
   |--tutorials/
   |  |--index.rst
   |--how_to/
   |  |--index.rst
   |--apidocs/
   |  |--index.rst
   |--explanations/
      |--index.rst

Sidebar
=======

Now that you have all the needed ``.rst`` files, you can create a sidebar for your documentation page. This can be done by linking to the files with a :rst:dir:`sphinx:toctree`
in ``docs/index.rst``.  Your ``index.rst`` should look like this:

.. code-block:: text

    ###############################################################################
    Welcome to <Enter your Project Name, e.g. Qiskit HAL Provider>'s documentation!
    ###############################################################################

    Overview
    ========

    Explain your package here.


    .. toctree::
       :hidden:

       Documentation Home <self>
       Getting Started <getting_started>
       Tutorials <tutorials/index>
       How-to Guides <how_to/index>
       API Reference <apidocs/index>
       Explanations <explanations/index>
       Release Notes <release_notes>
       GitHub <Enter Link to your Repository, e.g. https://github.com/hal/qiskit-hal-provider>


.. warning::

    We strongly recommend you follow this sidebar layout as closely as possible for your project, in order to maintain consistency with other projects using these standards.
    
    Additionally, if you are using the ``qiskit_sphinx_theme`` make sure you are not accidentally overriding the theme. If you add any files to your ``_templates`` or ``_static`` folders with the same name as a theme filename this could override the theme features and styles. It is not recommended to override the theme features unless you really need to. If the theme does not have functionality you need or you found a bug please open an issue for it at https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit_sphinx_theme/issues


Build your documentation locally
=================================

Now that you have created your documentation project, it's recommended to build it locally to check whether it looks and works as intended.

In order to do that, you first need to have your package installed. You can do this by running the following command on the root directory of your local copy of the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install .

Apart from the package, there are other dependencies that are necessary for building the documentation. All of them should be already included in the repo in a text file called ``requirements-dev.txt``,
so you only need to run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

The ``-r`` flag means that instead of installing a package called "`requirements-dev.txt`", you are installing the packages listed in the requirements text file ``requirements-dev.txt``.

Once you have made the installations, you can finally build your documentation with :doc:`sphinx:man/sphinx-build`, setting the builder (``-b``)
to ``html`` so the documents from the ``docs`` folder get built as HTML pages in a new folder, that you will call ``docs/_build/html``. So the final command is:

.. code-block:: bash

    sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html

The locally built page should look like this:

.. figure:: /images/local_build.png



Deploy docs to `qiskit.org/ecosystem <https://qiskit.org/ecosystem>`_
======================================================================

.. note:: 

   At the moment, this section is only applicable for selected Qiskit projects such as Qiskit and 
   Qiskit Nature. For other projects, you can deploy your own documentation using `Read the Docs
   <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/>`_ or GitHub pages.

Once you have a working documentation project, you may want to deploy it to `qiskit.org/ecosystem <https://qiskit.org/ecosystem>`_. This can be done by using `GitHub workflows <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows>`_.
These workflows are automated processes that are defined by `YAML <https://yaml.org/>`_ files. These files should be placed in a directory called ``.github/workflows``.

A workflow can be configured to be triggered by one or more events. It is divided into one or more jobs, each one formed by at least one step. A step consists of running a script you define or an `action <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#actions>`_,
that is, an application that performs a complex but usually repeated task.

For documentation deployment, create a file called ``deploy-docs.yml`` inside the directory ``.github/workflows``.

The first thing you need to include in this file is the name of your workflow via the key `name <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#name>`_. In particular, this workflow will be called ``Deploy Docs`` so your next line is:

.. code-block:: yaml

    name: Deploy Docs

The next step is to set the event that triggers this workflow. This is done with the key `on <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on>`_. In this case, the workflow will be triggered manually. This can be set with the `workflow_dispatch <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch>`_ event.

.. code-block:: yaml

    on:
      workflow_dispatch:

.. note::

    It is recommended to use a 2-space indentation for YAML files.

In order to avoid having more than one job or workflow running at the same time you will use a `concurrency group <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency>`_. The idea behind these groups is that only one job or workflow from each group can be run at the same time.
In this case we will distinguish by repository name, branch ref, source branch ref and workflow. All of these can be accessed via the `github <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context>`_ `context <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#about-contexts>`_ as ``github.repository``, ``github.ref``, ``github.head_ref`` and ``github.workflow`` respectively.
These properties can be accessed with the `expression syntax <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions>`_, that is, ``${{ <expression> }}``. In order to cancel any currently running workflows from the concurrency group you can set ``cancel-in-progress`` to ``true``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    concurrency:
      group: ${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.ref }}-${{ github.head_ref }}-${{ github.workflow }}
      cancel-in-progress: true


Once this setup is done, you can start creating the jobs. 

Publish docs
------------

The job will consist of publishing the documentation and will be called ``docs_publish``.  

Set up the job
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to make sure that the deployment only comes from a stable branch and is triggered by a maintainer, you can use the `if <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idif>`_
key. The first condition can be written using the `startsWith expression <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#startswith>`_ by checking whether ``github.ref`` starts with ``refs/heads/stable``. For the second condition, you can use the `contains expression <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#contains>`_ to check whether
``github.actor``, that is the user that triggers the workflow, is a maintainer. This job will use the latest version of `Ubuntu <https://ubuntu.com/>`_. To ensure that, you will set the `runs-on <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on>`_ key to ``ubuntu-latest``.
Finally, you will use the `strategy key <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategy>`_ to create a `matrix <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix>`_ in which the Python version will be included. In this case, the version will be 3.8.
This matrix will be called ``python-version`` and its value will be ``[3.8]``. 


.. code-block:: yaml

    jobs:
      docs_publish:
        if: ${{ startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/heads/stable') && contains('["maintainer-1","maintainer-2", ...]', github.actor) }}
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        strategy:
          matrix:
            python-version: [3.8]
        steps:

Steps
^^^^^

Check-out the repository
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

The first step of this job consists of enabling the workflow to access your repository. To do that you only need to call the latest version (version 3, ``@v3``) the pre-defined `checkout action <https://github.com/actions/checkout>`_ with the `uses <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsuses>`_ key.
By setting the ``fetch-depth`` parameter to ``0`` via the `with <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idwith>`_ key, you can let the action reach for the full history of your repository.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0


Setup Python
""""""""""""

Once your repo has been reached, the workflow continues by installing a Python version, in this case, the 3.8, as defined in ``matrix.python-version``. Fortunately, the
`setup-python action <https://github.com/actions/setup-python>`_ already does this for us!. To choose the Python version you only need to set the ``python-version`` parameter with the corresponding value.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}


Install the package
""""""""""""""""""""

Now that you have Python, let's install our package and its more immediate dependencies and constraints from ``requirements-dev.txt`` and ``constraints.txt`` respectively. 
You can use the `run <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsrun>`_ key and add the usual bash commands as a multiline block with the pipe indicator ``|``. These commands are: ``pip install -e .`` for the editable (``-e``) version of the package, ``pip install -U -r requirements-dev.txt`` for the latest version (``-U``) of the requirements (``-r``) and ``pip install -c constraints.txt`` for the constraints (``-c``).
You can set the shell to ``bash`` via the
`shell <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsshell>`_ keyword.


.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: Install <Package Name>
      run: |
        pip install -e .
        pip install -U -c constraints.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
      shell: bash


Install other dependencies
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In case there are another dependencies that are not covered in the ``requirements-dev.txt``, you can add them in a similar step.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: |
        pip install python_packages
        sudo apt-get install -y other_packages
      shell: bash

The meaning of these Python dependencies is that they are not needed for our package to work nor to build documentation in general but might be used in some specific part of it. For example,
the `Torch Connector tutorial <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-machine-learning/blob/main/docs/tutorials/05_torch_connector.ipynb>`_ from `qiskit-machine-learning <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-machine-learning>`_ uses
the Python package ``torchvision`` to load a dataset. This repo also includes some non-Python dependencies like ``pandoc`` or ``graphviz`` that can't be installed with ``pip``, so
`apt-get <https://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get>`_ has to be used instead.

Build and publish to qiskit.org/ecosystem
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you are deploying your documentation to a qiskit.org/ecosystem domain, then your documentation will need to be deployed to `IBM Cloud Object Storage <https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage>`_, where qiskit.org is hosted, with `Rclone <https://rclone.org>`_, a command-line program that enables you to manage content from the cloud.

Before starting with this step, it is necessary to ask a `Qiskit organization administrator <https://github.com/orgs/Qiskit/people?query=role%3Aowner>`_ to create a data container or `bucket <https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/manage-data/cos_buckets.html?locale=en>`_ called, following our HAL Provider example, ``qiskit-org-web-resources/ecosystem/hal-provider``, from whose content the page ``qiskit.org/ecosystem/hal-provider`` will be generated,
and to add some encrypted credentials to your repo. These credentials are:

* The `Rclone <https://rclone.org>`_ configuration file, that will be saved as ``tools/rclone.conf.enc``.
* The secret key and `initialization vector <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector>`_ with which that configuration file is encrypted, that will be saved as `repository secrets <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository>`_ called ``encrypted_rclone_key`` and ``encrypted_rclone_iv`` respectively.

.. note::

    Both the configuration file, secret key and initialization vector are the same across all of the Ecosystem's packages supported by IBM. They can be found
    `in this repository <https://github.ibm.com/IBM-Q-Software/qiskit-community-mgt/>`_ as ``rclone.conf.txt`` and ``rclone_encrypt_secrets.txt``.

Once these credentials are included in your repo, you can set up the environment variables needed for this step. This is done with the `env <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsenv>`_ keyword.
The first two variables will be the ``encrypted_rclone_key`` and ``encrypted_rclone_iv``, that can be accessed with the `secrets context <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#secrets-context>`_ and the `expression syntax <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions>`_, that is, ``${{ <expression> }}``.
Then, you will disable the use of `Python multiprocessing <https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html>`_ to parallelize operations by setting the ``QISKIT_PARALLEL`` variable to ``False`` and enable the tutorials build by setting the ``QISKIT_DOCS_BUILD_TUTORIALS`` to ``'always'``.
So the step will start looking like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: Build and publish
      env:
        encrypted_rclone_key: ${{ secrets.encrypted_rclone_key }}
        encrypted_rclone_iv: ${{ secrets.encrypted_rclone_iv }}
        QISKIT_PARALLEL: False
        QISKIT_DOCS_BUILD_TUTORIALS: 'always'

When deploying documentation to qiskit.org/ecosystem, it's important to make sure that only the release notes that correspond to the desired release are being uploaded. For this purpose you will create a subscript called ``tools/ignore_untagged_notes.sh`` that will be called from the workflow.
This file will start with this `shebang <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash

Its function is to indicate that the script will be run with the Bash shell.


The first thing you will want to find is the tag that corresponds to the latest release of your package. This is precisely the idea behind `git describe <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-describe>`_.
In particular, you can use the ``--tags`` option to ensure all the tags are used instead of only the annotated ones and the ``--abrev=0`` option to suppress long format. This value will be useful later, so you'll save
it as a variable called ``LATEST_TAG`` with the ``VARIABLE=$(command)`` syntax from Bash.

.. code-block:: bash

    LATEST_TAG=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)

Then you need to look for the files that don't have this tag. A way to do this is using `git diff <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff>`_ with the ``--name-only`` option to compare only the names of the files that are different between the current version of your repo
(``HEAD``) and the latest tag (the variable ``LATEST_TAG``, that has to be referred with the ``$VARIABLE`` syntax). You need the name of all of the release notes (that are placed in ``releasenotes/notes``) to be added to an ignore list (that will be created with this script into ``docs/release_notes.rst``).
This ignore list uses the `reno Sphinx <https://docs.openstack.org/reno/latest/user/sphinxext.html#directive-release-notes>`_ and will have this structure:

.. code-block:: bash

    .. release-notes::
       :ignore-notes:
         ignored_release_note_1,
         ignored_release_note_2,
         ...


The idea is then that for any changed file, you will check if it starts with ``releasenotes/notes``. If that's the case, you will check whether it's already part of the ignore list.
In case it's not part of that list, first you'll check if that list exists already. If it does not, you'll create it by adding the heading ``:ignore-notes:``.
Then the release note is added to the list.

The code for this process is then:

.. code-block:: bash

    for file_changed in `git diff --name-only HEAD $LATEST_TAG`
    do
        if [[ $file_changed == releasenotes/notes/* ]]; then
            isInFile=$(grep -Exq "\s*$file_changed," docs/release_notes.rst >/dev/null; echo $?)
            if [ $isInFile -ne 0 ]; then
                isInFile=$(grep -Exq "\s*:ignore-notes:\s*" docs/release_notes.rst >/dev/null; echo $?)
                if [ $isInFile -ne 0 ]; then
                    echo "   :ignore-notes:" >> docs/release_notes.rst
                fi
                echo "Release note changed since $LATEST_TAG: $file_changed. Ignore in docs/release_notes.rst"
                echo "     $file_changed," >> docs/release_notes.rst
            fi
        fi
    done

Note that the first ``if`` requires double square brackets (``[[ condition ]]``) because it's comparing a variable to the string ``releasenotes/notes/*``, which uses the wildcard ``*`` to indicate that it begins by ``releasenotes/notes/``.
In order to check whether a string is in ``docs/release_notes.rst``, this script is defining the variable ``isInFile`` as the exit code (``echo $?``) of ``grep -Exq your_string docs/release_notes.rst >/dev/null``.
This command would give as output any line that includes the string ``your_string`` but we are not interested in that output, so we erase it by directing it to ``dev/null``, as we only want to know whether the file was found (exit code ``0``).
The ``-E`` flag means that patterns are seen as `extended regular expressions <https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html#Basic-vs-Extended>`_, so ``\s*`` means zero or more (``*``) whitespaces (``\s``) instead of being a literal string.
Given the structure of the ignore list, we want to make sure that the line consists of only the expression we are looking for, so we use the ``-x`` flag for this purpose.
Finally, the ``-q`` flag ensures that no output is written and exit status is 0 if a match is found, ignoring any errors. Also note that when ``:ignore-notes:`` and the file names are added to the ignore list, the indentation is respected.

After that, you will print the files of ``docs/release_notes.rst``. This could be done with ``cat docs/release_notes.rst``, but we want to remove any extra whitespaces or line breaks, so you will use this instead:

.. code-block:: bash

    echo "Contents of docs/release_notes.rst:"
    echo $(cat docs/release_notes.rst)

That way ``echo`` removes the format from the output of ``cat docs/release_notes.rst``.

Then you will return the status code 0 if the end of the script is reached with:

.. code-block:: bash

    exit 0

So the ``tools/ignore_untagged_notes.sh`` file will look like this:

.. code-block:: bash

            fi
        fi
    done

    echo "Contents of docs/release_notes.rst:"
    echo "$(cat docs/release_notes.rst)"

    exit 0

Now you only need to set the final script to deploy the documentation! This subscript will be called ``tools/deploy_documentation.sh``.
Like ``tools/ignore_untagged_notes``, this has to start by setting the shell to ``bash``:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash


In order to cancel the deployment if an error occurs, you will add this line:

.. code-block:: bash

    set -e

That means that if any command exits with a non-zero exit code, the execution of this script will be aborted.


Now you will use `curl <https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html>`_ to download the latest Linux version of `Rclone <https://rclone.org>`_, that can be found at `<https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-linux-amd64.deb>`_, and save it as a file called ``rclone.deb`` via the ``-o`` option.
Then you will download the file with `apt-get install <https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man8/apt-get.8.html>`_ with the ``-y`` flag to automatically answer "yes" to any question that may appear as part of an interactive download.

.. code-block:: bash

    curl https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-linux-amd64.deb -o rclone.deb
    sudo apt-get install -y ./rclone.deb

Now that you have installed Rclone, you can use the ``rclone`` commands. In particular, you can use ``rclone config file`` to find the Rclone configuration file and assign it to a variable ``RCLONE_CONFIG_PATH``.

.. code-block:: bash

    RCLONE_CONFIG_PATH=$(rclone config file | tail -1)

The reason behind the ``| tail -1`` is that the standard output of ``rclone config file`` is:

.. code-block:: console

    Configuration file is stored at:
    /Users/user/.config/rclone/rclone.conf

or, if you don't have any Rclone configuration file,

.. code-block:: console

    Configuration file doesn't exist, but rclone will use this path:
    /Users/user/.config/rclone/rclone.conf

So in both cases, the only element we are interested in (the path) is the last one (``tail -1``).

You can show the current working directory with:

.. code-block:: bash

    echo "show current dir: "
    pwd


Then you will use the AES-256-CBC (256 bit `Advanced Encryption Standard <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard>`_ with `Cypher block chaining <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_block_chaining_(CBC)>`_) algorithm with the `openssl <https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man1/openssl-enc.html>`_ command, along with the ``encrypted_rclone_key`` (key or ``-K``) and ``encrypted_rclone_iv`` (``-iv``) to decrypt (``-d``) the encrypted Rclone configuration file included in the repository, ``tools/rclone.conf.enc`` (input or ``-in``), and put its content (output or ``-out``) into
the Rclone configuration file from ``RCLONE_CONFIG_PATH``.

.. code-block:: bash

    openssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_rclone_key -iv $encrypted_rclone_iv -in tools/rclone.conf.enc -out $RCLONE_CONFIG_PATH -d

Now that your Rclone has the configuration needed to deploy the documentation, it's time to do it. The command that enables you to upload the built docs from ``docs/_build/html`` to the corresponding `IBM Cloud Object Storage <https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage>`_ instance (in our case, ``qiskit-org-web-resources/ecosystem/hal-provider``) is `rclone sync <https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/>`_.
You can use the ``--progress`` flag to get updates of the synchronization process. You need to exclude the files from ``locale`` with the ``--exclude`` flag.

.. code-block:: bash

    rclone sync --progress --exclude locale/** ./docs/_build/html IBMCOS:qiskit-org-web-resources/ecosystem/<Enter Your Project Name, e.g. hal-provider>

The full ``tools/deploy_documentation.sh`` should then look like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash

    # Script for pushing the documentation to the qiskit.org/ecosystem.
    set -e

    curl https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-linux-amd64.deb -o rclone.deb
    sudo apt-get install -y ./rclone.deb

    RCLONE_CONFIG_PATH=$(rclone config file | tail -1)

    echo "show current dir: "
    pwd

    # Push to qiskit.org/ecosystem
    openssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_rclone_key -iv $encrypted_rclone_iv -in tools/rclone.conf.enc -out $RCLONE_CONFIG_PATH -d
    echo "Pushing built docs to website"
    rclone sync --progress --exclude locale/** ./docs/_build/html IBMCOS:qiskit-org-web-resources/ecosystem/<Enter Your Project Name, e.g. hal-provider>



Now that all the subscripts are done, you can put them together to finish the docs deployment process, along with building the documentation with :doc:`sphinx:man/sphinx-build`.
You also need to add ``earliest_version: 0.1.0`` to ``releasenotes/config.yaml`` so `reno <https://docs.openstack.org/reno/latest/>`_ can find the release notes.

.. code-block:: yaml

    run: |
      echo "earliest_version: 0.1.0" >> releasenotes/config.yaml
      tools/ignore_untagged_notes.sh
      sphinx-build -b html docs/ docs/_build/html
      tools/deploy_documentation.sh
    shell: bash

So the final version of this step is:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: Build and publish
      env:
        encrypted_rclone_key: ${{ secrets.encrypted_rclone_key }}
        encrypted_rclone_iv: ${{ secrets.encrypted_rclone_iv }}
        QISKIT_PARALLEL: False
        QISKIT_DOCS_BUILD_TUTORIALS: 'always'
      run: |
        echo "earliest_version: 0.1.0" >> releasenotes/config.yaml
        tools/ignore_untagged_notes.sh
        sphinx-build -b html docs/ docs/_build/html
        tools/deploy_documentation.sh
      shell: bash


The complete ``.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`` is then:
