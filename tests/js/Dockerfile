# This Dockerfile allows us to run our snapshot tests locally. That avoids issues with CI and local
# differing. In CI, we also run with the same base image.
# See https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots.
#
# Note that we build the Sphinx docs outside of this Docker image; we only need to run the
# server inside Docker so that the docs are rendered the same locally and in CI.


# Keep this base image in sync with .github/workflows/main.yml.
